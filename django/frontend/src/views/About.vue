        <h1>SeaTime Web Application for Mariners</h1>
        <p>The App (For lack of a better title)

            Overview:
            Seatime.com is currently some dude's personal bulshit picture website that hasnt been updated since 2006
            (when Facebook came online.) We should buy it. Some French guy. Unless that's not a good name? It’s just the
            name I’ve been working under, but I’m not necessarily attached to it. Let Shawn and the marketing guys
            figure that part out.

            For the mariner, this platform will provide a service by collecting and simplifying the many aspects of
            being a professional mariner.
            The App will log seatime by date, vessel specifics, and position served. This allows for the calculation of
            progress towards career advancement opportunities.
            Reminders can be sent when important documents and certifications are due to expire, and provide resources
            for renewal.
            Using previously entered personal profile information, PDF forms can be auto-completed (ex. Pre-filled TWIC
            renewal paperwork to make life easier)
            This part of the service may be free or on a subscription basis (Personally, I wouldn't pay for this. But
            then again I don't even pay for Pandora. -Anthony)

            For the employer, this platform will be a database of mariners that can be searched by qualifications.
            Mariners can elect to be available for recruiting or now
            Employers can search out and contact eligible mariners with job opportunities.
            Recruiting is usually time consuming and expensive. Making a searchable database could be valuable.

            Advertisers/Retailers/Training Programs can advertise on the platform.
            Retailers and Advertisers can advertise as usual on an app.
            Training Programs can be targeted to each mariner based on what training they do not yet have or what will
            expire soon. For instance, when a mariner’s firefighting certification is due to expire in six months,
            discount offers can be made available from participating schools to drive traffic.

            Vessel data collection
            Apparently verifying vessel machinery, cargo, and other particulars is big business in the insurance
            industry. Mariners can input data in real time or verify records for the benefit of insurers. The mariner
            can be incentivized with discounts/freebies/etc???


            App Parts:

            Login: Basic username/password stuff. Each user will of course need a unique identifier to keep records
            straight.

            Dashboard: The landing page or opening screen of the app. This will show basic mariner info such as Name,
            Mariner Reference Number, highest rate or license, seatime tallies, and important expiration dates, along
            with any other info or app-related features that may be immediately useful upon startup.

            Profile: Basic user information. Name, date of birth, citizenship, drivers license/MMC/med cert/firefighting
            expiration dates. This is all user submitted information; whether they are wrong or not it up to them. Some
            of this information will need to be saved as it changes, especially the MMC rate/license info because
            experience matters when applying for the next advancement.
            Perhaps a feature will be to have a “Verified” option, so that we can see their documents, check with the
            CG, and make sure they are good to go. This makes that candidate more valuable to recruiters.

            Resume: This is career related information, as well as contact information if they give permission for
            recruiters to contact them. Also have an option to upload an actual resume document file that can be
            accessed by potential employers.

            Seatime: This is where a mariner inputs their sailing time. During or after each hitch, the mariner will
            input the dates arrived and departed the ship, position sailed (QMED, 3AE, 2nd Mate, etc), and select the
            ship from a dropdown menu. The selection from the menu will pull data from MarineTraffic.com to fill in
            Official/IMO number, tonnage, class, horsepower, and other vessel particulars. This data will be used to
            track a mariners career progression so that accurate seatime can be tallied.

            Courses and Training: As a mariner progresses through their career, various training courses are required.
            Deals can be made with the training schools to advertise on the app. When a mariner’s Basic Training and
            Firefighting certificates are ready to expire, the training schools can provide discounts and offers to
            drive traffic.

            Deals and Discounts: Retailers can advertise to a targeted audience.
